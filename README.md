# Eminently-Secure-System
The implemented system is configured in combination of hardware components and software application. The hardware components will enable the protection of server’s confidential data, with implementation of authentication which ultimately controls the power supply. The Power supply for the server will be controlled using a micro controller. It will be compatible with password protection. Also there will be a locking device which will perform the process to lock the panels of the server, so as to protect the hard drive. In addition to this the software application will control the authenticity of user’s information. The layered architecture will help to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity even if any hardware component is compromised.
